<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <pre>
TIKCOIN is a project built on the philosophy of time.
We cannot stop time.
We cannot reverse time.
We cannot deceive time.
But we can tokenize it.

Time is the only universal unit of measurement.
It is equal for everyone: for the rich and the poor, for the early and the late.
That is why we made it the foundation of our system.

TIKCOIN is not just a cryptocurrency.
It is a digital era where honesty and equality are embedded in code.
There are no hidden rules, no manual overrides, no privileges.
Every participant becomes the master of their own time.

Our project stands on four pillars:
 • Time. The laws of time are reflected in code.
 • Honesty. Smart contracts are transparent and immutable.
 • Equality. All participants follow the same rules.
 • Trust. Those who believed earlier are rewarded more.

Project Goal — to create a digital system where time becomes currency, and trust and equality are embedded in code. We are building not just a token, but a mechanism of the Golden Age: an era where every second has value.

  <h2>Chapter 1. Doctrine of Time</h2>
  <pre>
The Doctrine of Time is the foundation of TIKCOIN.
It is built on three undeniable truths:
  1. Time cannot be stopped.
   • It moves forward without pause or interruption.
   • In our code, this is reflected by the absence of “pause” or freeze functions: the system cannot be halted.
   • No one can ever stop the flow of time inside TIKCOIN.
  2. Time cannot be reversed.
   • Every second is gone forever.
   • In TIKCOIN, this is enforced through finality: no hidden inflation, no additional minting, no way to “go back.”
   • Every transaction and every distribution is irreversible.
  3. Time cannot be deceived.
   • Any attempt to cheat time fails, and this principle is embedded in our architecture.
   • TIKCOIN smart contracts contain no backdoors, no blacklists, no privileges for special addresses.
   • Everything is honest and transparent: the rules are visible and verifiable on-chain.

These three axioms form the law at the heart of the project.
The Doctrine of Time makes TIKCOIN not just a token, but a reflection of reality itself in digital form.

<a id="roadmap"></a>
  <h2>Chapter 2. Roadmap (Project Evolution)</h2>
  <pre>
The evolution of TIKCOIN mirrors the flow of time. Our roadmap is built as a sequence of stages, each irreversible, like the passing of seconds.

0. The Zero Stage: The Beginning
TIKCOIN starts with an idea and the first smart contract. This is the moment where the token, the philosophy, and the rules of the game are born.

0.1 Version 1 — Core Contract
 • Launch of TIKP (ERC20, non-transferable, capped).
 • First airdrop for the community.
 • Demonstration of honesty: all distributions happen only through the contract.
Why this way? Version 1 builds trust: the code is open, verifiable, simple, with no loopholes.

0.2 Version 1.5 — Presale
 • Presale mechanism launch.
 • Fixed price: $0.01 per TIK.
 • Statuses assigned (Sun → Quantum Clock).
 • Bonus levels locked forever.
Why this way? Presale reflects trust: those who believed earlier are rewarded more.

0.3 Version 2 — DEX Listing
 • Migration to the final immutable contract (TIK V2).
 • Listing on decentralized exchanges.
 • Liquidity creation: 85% into pools, 15% for development and audits.
Why this way? DEX = fair trading without intermediaries. Liquidity is locked, price is set by the market.

0.4 Version 3 — Ecosystem Expansion
 • Telegram bot for tracking and voting.
 • Community governance integration.
 • First stage of user involvement in decision-making.
Why this way? This is the stage of honesty: every TIK holder becomes a participant, not just a spectator.

0.5 Version 4 — CEX Listing
 • Listing on centralized exchanges.
 • Larger audience reach.
 • Stronger liquidity and brand presence.
Why this way? CEX comes only after proving honesty on DEX.

0.6 Version 5 — NFT & Collaborations
 • Launch of NFT collection (Sun → Quantum Clock).
 • Collaborations with projects sharing transparency and honesty.
Why this way? NFTs and collaborations strengthen memetics and attract new communities.

0.7 Version 6 — Quantum Clock (Final Stage)
 • Final expansion: Quantum level.
 • DAO governance fully integrated.
 • Voting on strategic directions.
 • TIKCOIN enters the top-50 cryptocurrencies.
Why this way? The Quantum stage symbolizes infinity. The system becomes self-sustaining and independent from its creators.

  </pre>
</section>
<section id="chapter-3">
  <h2>Chapter 3. Tokenomics</h2>
  <pre>
The TIKCOIN economy is designed so that every second has value, and distribution remains fair and transparent.
There are no promises of endless emissions, no hidden inflation. The total supply equals the number of seconds in a century.

3.1 Principle
	•	1 TIK = 1 second.
	•	Total: 3,155,760,000 TIK.
	•	This number will never change.
	•	No hidden minting, no inflation, no manual control.

3.2 Distribution
	•	35% Presale.
A fair launch. Early participants fund the project and receive tokens at a fixed price of $0.01.
	•	20% Airdrop.
Rewards for the community that spends its most valuable resource — time.
	•	15% Development & Audit Reserve.
Funds to cover coding, audits, and improvements. A transparent development reserve.
	•	20% Marketing & Growth.
Supporting memetics, media presence, and community growth. Locked and released gradually.
	•	10% Founders.
Founders receive tokens under the same conditions as everyone else: unlocked gradually over 12 months after all others.

3.3 Logic of Distribution
	•	Presale (35%) reflects trust: those who believed first form the project’s core.
	•	Airdrop (20%) reinforces equality: those who contributed time are rewarded just like investors.
	•	Development (15%) ensures stability: the project can evolve without market pressure.
	•	Marketing (20%) emphasizes memetics: a project must live not only in code but also in culture.
	•	Founders (10%) prove honesty: creators play by the same rules as everyone else.

3.4 Transparency
	•	85% of presale funds go to liquidity.
	•	15% are reserved for development and audits.
	•	All conditions are embedded in smart contracts and verifiable on-chain.
  </pre>
</section>

<section id="chapter-4">
  <h2>Chapter 4. Airdrop — Time as Value</h2>
  <pre>
In TIKCOIN, an airdrop is not a giveaway of “free tokens.” It is a reward for the most valuable resource we have — time.

4.1 Principle
 • Participants spend time: subscribing, sharing, creating memes, building the community.
 • In return, they receive TIK.
 • No purchases, no hidden conditions. Only one rule: “You give time → you earn TIK.”

4.2 Mechanics
 • 20% of the total supply is allocated to airdrops.
 • These tokens cannot be used for anything else. They are permanently locked for airdrops.
 • Distributions are secured with snapshots and executed transparently via smart contracts.

4.3 Time Trust Bonuses
 • A part of the airdrop is reserved for trust bonuses:
 • early participants,
 • active community builders,
 • meme creators,
 • discussion leaders.
 • These bonuses cannot be bought or assigned manually.
 • They reflect the principle: those who believed earlier, and invested their time earlier, receive greater rewards.

4.4 Honesty
 • No “chosen” addresses.
 • No manual overrides.
 • All conditions are the same for everyone.
  </pre>
</section>

<section id="chapter-5">
  <h2>Chapter 5. Presale — Trust in Action</h2>
  <pre>
The Presale of TIKCOIN is the foundational stage where participants contribute not only their time but also their resources to the project. This is where the community’s core is formed, and the rules of honesty are locked in.

5.1 Principle
	•	Fixed price: $0.01 per TIK.
	•	No “early insider” or private rounds.
	•	Everyone buys at the same price.

Why this way?
Because trust cannot be sold at different prices. It must be equal for everyone.

⸻

5.2 Mechanics
	•	35% of total supply allocated to Presale.
	•	Funds are distributed as follows:
	•	85% → liquidity on DEX;
	•	15% → project development (code, audit, marketing).
	•	Presale participants immediately secure a status level (from Sun to Quantum Clock).

⸻

5.3 Statuses
	•	Sun — the base level, accessible to all.
	•	Hourglass, Mechanism, Quartz, Tourbillon, Atom, Quantum Clock — levels depending on contribution.
	•	Maximum contribution: $50,000 per wallet.
	•	Status obtained during Presale is permanent. It cannot be purchased later or lost.

⸻

5.4 Honesty & Equality
	•	Everyone participates under equal conditions.
	•	No privileged addresses.
	•	Founders’ tokens unlock only after everyone else’s.
	•	Statuses permanently reflect trust and contribution.

⸻

5.5 Logic

The Presale reflects the laws of time:
	•	It cannot be stopped. Presale runs as planned, without pauses.
	•	It cannot be reversed. All transactions are final.
	•	It cannot be deceived. Rules are open, contract is transparent, conditions are equal.

Presale is the moment of truth: those who believe in the project before launch receive status and become the foundation of the “Golden Age.”
  </pre>
</section>

<section id="chapter-6">
  <h2>Chapter 6. Presale Bonus Levels — Trust Measured by Contribution</h2>
  <pre>
The Presale not only fixes statuses but also introduces a bonus system that reflects a simple truth: the earlier and greater the belief → the greater the reward.

⸻

6.1 Principle
 • Bonuses are granted only during Presale.
 • After Presale ends, bonuses cannot be earned.
 • All bonuses are paid from the Airdrop pool (20%), enforced by the contract.

⸻

6.2 Levels and Bonuses

Each Presale level has its own minimum threshold and bonus percentage:
 • Sun — free (no bonus).
 • Hourglass — contribution from $300 → 0% bonus.
 • Mechanism — contribution from $1,000 → +2.5% bonus.
 • Quartz — contribution from $5,000 → +5% bonus.
 • Tourbillon — contribution from $10,000 → +10% bonus.
 • Atom — contribution from $25,000 → +20% bonus.
 • Quantum Clock — contribution from $50,000 → +30% bonus (and this is the maximum per wallet).

⸻

6.3 Philosophy of Bonuses
 • Bonuses are not “discounts.” They are a symbol of trust.
 • The greater the belief in the project, the higher the status and the bonus.
 • After Presale, bonuses cannot be obtained. Statuses and bonuses become part of TIKCOIN’s history.

⸻

6.4 Honesty
 • All levels and percentages are known in advance.
 • No hidden conditions or “special deals.”
 • The maximum bonus level is available to anyone contributing $50,000.

⸻

6.5 Logic
 • Why are bonuses paid from the Airdrop pool?
Because trust = time, and contribution to the project is also a form of trust. That’s why we use the same pool as a symbol of recognition.
  </pre>
</section>

<section id="chapter-7">
  <h2>Chapter 7. Presale Bonus Airdrop — Trust Secured by Time</h2>
  <pre>
The Presale Bonus Airdrop is the second part of the airdrop program. While the base Airdrop (Chapter 4) rewards time, the bonus Airdrop rewards the trust of those who contributed resources to the project during Presale.

⸻

7.1 Principle
 • All Presale bonuses are paid exclusively from the Airdrop pool (20%).
 • Bonuses cannot come from any other source.
 • The mechanism is tied to status levels (see Chapter 6).

⸻

7.2 How it Works
 • A Presale participant buys tokens at the fixed price of $0.01.
 • At the end of Presale, the final contribution of each participant is recorded.
 • Based on their level (Mechanism → Quantum Clock), they receive a bonus.
 • Bonuses are paid only with Airdrop tokens, with no inflation or extra minting.

⸻

7.3 Logic of Trust
 • Time = value (Airdrop).
 • Contribution = trust (Presale).
 • Presale bonuses are the bridge between time and trust.
 • Those who believed earlier and stronger are rewarded more.

⸻

7.4 Honesty
 • All bonus conditions are known in advance.
 • No manual assignments or hidden rules.
 • Bonuses are distributed automatically at the end of Presale, in one moment.

⸻

7.5 Symbolism
 • The Airdrop reflects time.
 • The Presale Bonus Airdrop reflects trust.
 • Together, they show: TIKCOIN values both time and contribution.
  </pre>
</section>

<section id="chapter-8">
  <h2>Chapter 8. Governance — Honesty in Decision-Making</h2>
  <pre>
TIKCOIN was built as a project where honesty lies not only in code but also in governance. We believe that anyone who contributed time or resources deserves a voice in shaping the future.

⸻

8.1 Principle
 • Governance belongs to the community.
 • No “developer power” or hidden admins.
 • Decisions are made through built-in voting mechanisms.

⸻

8.2 Who Votes
 • Voting rights belong to Tourbillon, Atom, and Quantum Clock levels.
 • This symbolizes responsibility: those who contributed the most resources and trust shape the direction.
 • Sun, Hourglass, Mechanism, and Quartz remain participants, but without governance votes.

⸻

8.3 How Voting Works
 • Voting occurs through a Telegram bot and a governance Dashboard.
 • Results are enforced by smart contracts, preventing manipulation.
 • Every decision is transparent and verifiable on-chain.

⸻

8.4 What the Community Decides
 • Vesting schedules and unlock conditions.
 • Ecosystem development directions.
 • New feature launches (NFT, DAO integrations, collaborations).
 • Listing priorities and marketing budget allocations.

⸻

8.5 Logic of Trust
 • Why only Tourbillon and above?
Because governance requires responsibility.
Those who contributed more resources demonstrated greater trust and thus earn decision-making power.

⸻

8.6 Symbolism
 • Governance reflects the principle: honesty is not only equal rules but equal rights.
 • Everyone has the chance to reach a status that grants governance power.
 • TIKCOIN becomes a clock of trust, where every tick = a voice of the community.
  </pre>
</section>

<section id="chapter-9">
  <h2>Chapter 9. Marketing & Memetics — The Power of Time in Culture</h2>
  <pre>
TIKCOIN cannot be seen only as a smart contract. It is a cultural phenomenon. It is a meme. It is the symbol of time, spreading as naturally as the ticking of a clock.

⸻

9.1 Principle of Memetics
 • Memes = a tool of trust.
 • The symbolism of time (Sun → Quantum Clock) becomes the project’s visual language.
 • Every user can become a creator of memes, quotes, and symbols.

⸻

9.2 Marketing Waves
 • Promotion flows in waves, like the rhythm of time.
 • Each wave has a theme: Presale launch, Airdrop, DEX listing, CEX listing, collaborations.
 • At the end of each wave, results are summed up, and a new one begins.

⸻

9.3 Promotion Formats
 • Community marketing: memes, posts, Telegram, Twitter, Discord, Reddit.
 • Collaborations: NFT projects, crypto media, influencers.
 • Traditional marketing: PR campaigns, articles, crypto outlets.

⸻

9.4 Honesty in Marketing
 • 20% of tokens are allocated to marketing but locked and released gradually.
 • All marketing expenses are transparent and published in the Dashboard.
 • Participants can track exactly how funds are used.

⸻

9.5 Symbolism
 • Memes = a new kind of “time mechanism,” where every tick is a new symbol.
 • By spreading memes, participants become watchmakers of TIKCOIN, building the collective “Golden Age.”
  </pre>
</section>

<section id="chapter-10">
  <h2>Chapter 10. Transparency — The Open Mechanism of Time</h2>
  <pre>
Time is always transparent: it flows equally for everyone. TIKCOIN is built on the same principle.

⸻

10.1 Principle
 • No hidden functions.
 • No “black boxes.”
 • All processes are visible to the community and verifiable on-chain.

⸻

10.2 Code
 • TIKCOIN source code is open and verified.
 • Contracts are audited by independent security researchers.
 • Anyone can review the rules and confirm their immutability.

⸻

10.3 Finances
 • 85% of Presale funds go to liquidity.
 • 15% are strictly allocated to development (code, audits, marketing).
 • All transactions are published and publicly verifiable.

⸻

10.4 Governance
 • Votes take place through the Telegram bot and Dashboard.
 • Results are enforced by smart contracts and visible to all.
 • No manual overrides are possible.

⸻

10.5 Symbolism
 • Transparency = trust.
 • Just as time is visible to all, TIKCOIN’s rules are open to everyone.
 • This makes the system not only honest but also resilient: trust is built on verification.
  </pre>
</section>

<section id="chapter-11">
  <h2>Chapter 11. Trust — The Foundation of the Golden Age</h2>
  <pre>
TIKCOIN is built on a simple principle: time treats everyone equally, but trust sets people apart.
Those who believed earlier, and contributed more time and resources, receive greater rewards.

⸻

11.1 Principle
 • Time cannot be stopped, reversed, or deceived.
 • But trust is something each person chooses.
 • TIKCOIN turns trust into measurable power: statuses, bonuses, voting rights.

⸻

11.2 How Trust is Measured
 • By time: joining airdrops, being active in the community, creating memes.
 • By resources: participating in the Presale, contributing to liquidity.
 • By actions: voting, collaborations, developing the ecosystem.

⸻

11.3 Rewards for Trust
 • Airdrop = reward for trust in time.
 • Presale Bonus = reward for trust in resources.
 • Governance = reward for trust in actions.
 • Statuses (Sun → Quantum Clock) permanently record this trust.

⸻

11.4 Honesty of Trust
 • No one can “buy” trust after the Presale.
 • No one can “undo” trust once it is shown.
 • The system is equal for all: once contributed → level is locked forever.

⸻

11.5 Symbolism
 • Trust = the energy that powers the clock.
 • Without trust, the hands cannot move.
 • Every contribution of time or resources becomes a ticking gear driving us toward the Golden Age.
  </pre>
</section>

<section id="chapter-12">
  <h2>Chapter 12. Utility — Time in Action</h2>
  <pre>
TIK is not just a number in a wallet. It is a token of time, usable both inside the ecosystem and beyond.

⸻

12.1 Principle
 • One TIK = one second.
 • A universal unit of time to spend, store, and utilize.
 • Unlike other tokens, TIK is not just a “project currency” but a digital measurement of time.

⸻

12.2 Inside the Ecosystem
 • Governance voting: Tourbillon, Atom, and Quantum Clock use TIK for decision-making.
 • Community tools: Telegram bots and Dashboard functions (polls, staking ideas, collaborations).
 • Airdrop mechanics: TIK powers memes, challenges, and engagement.

⸻

12.3 Beyond the Ecosystem
 • NFTs: collections where each NFT is tied to an amount of TIK (e.g., NFT chronometers).
 • Payments: TIK as a universal unit of time in partner projects.
 • Collaborations: integrations with DAOs, metaverses, and external services.

⸻

12.4 Symbolism
 • TIK = tokenized century.
 • Each TIK carries the idea: “We cannot stop time, but we can tokenize it.”
 • Utility makes philosophy practical: time becomes a resource to manage.

⸻

12.5 Logic of Trust
 • Utility is based on honesty: no artificial taxes, hidden functions, bridges, or manipulations.
 • All uses of TIK are open, verifiable, and accessible to everyone.
  </pre>

  <h2>Chapter 14. Ethical Standards — Honesty as the Core Mechanism</h2>
  <pre>
Time is fair: it flows equally for everyone. TIKCOIN must follow the same law.
Ethics in the project are not a statement but a technically enforced principle that no one can override.

⸻

14.1 Principle
 • No hidden functions.
 • No pauses, blacklists, or admin overrides.
 • The contract has no owner and cannot be altered.

⸻

14.2 What TIKCOIN Does Not Have
 • No bridges: they always carry critical vulnerabilities.
 • No transaction taxes: every tick equals one second and is equal for all.
 • No privileged accounts: the creator follows the same rules as the community.
 • No manual adjustments: all processes are automatic, enforced by code.

⸻

14.3 What TIKCOIN Has
 • Immutability: code becomes unchangeable after deployment.

  <section id="outro">
  <h2>Conclusion — Everything Begins and Ends in Time</h2>

  <p>We can debate prices, tokenomics, and exchanges. But one thing cannot be changed: time.
  It flows equally for everyone, yet each person chooses how to use it.</p>

  <p>TIKCOIN was born from three axioms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Time cannot be stopped.</li>
    <li>Time cannot be reversed.</li>
    <li>Time cannot be deceived.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We created a token where one tick = one second. We tokenized an entire century.
  This is not just numbers on a blockchain — it is a fundamental idea of equality:
  everyone has time, but each uses it differently.</p>

  <p>TIKCOIN is a philosophy of honesty:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Airdrop rewards those who contributed their time.</li>
    <li>Presale rewards those who contributed resources and trust.</li>
    <li>Governance gives a voice to those who proved their commitment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All are equal before time, but trust sets us apart.
  Those who believed earlier and contributed more are rewarded more.
  It is fair, because that is how nature itself works.</p>

  <p>We are not offering you to buy a “coin.”<br>
  We are offering you to become part of the Golden Age of Time.<br>
  <strong>TIKCOIN is the clock that will keep ticking as long as blockchain exists.</strong></p>
