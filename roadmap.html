<!-- ROADMAP -->
<h2 id="roadmap">3.X Roadmap — In Plain Words</h2>
<p>
  We keep our roadmap simple and honest. No buzzwords, no empty promises.
  Below is what we plan to do <em>before listing</em>. Everything beyond that is guided by one rule:
  <strong>Time Will Tell</strong>.
</p>

<h3>V1 — Prototype (☀️ Sun)</h3>
<p>
  First workable foundation. Think of it as laying the rails before the train:
  a prototype token for staging, the distribution logic for the airdrop, and a safe multisig.
  It’s not a “finished product” — it’s the start you can inspect and critique.
</p>

<h3>V1.5 — Presale Prep (⏳ Hourglass)</h3>
<p>
  We tighten the prototype, prepare for audit, and open the presale at <strong>$0.01</strong>.
  Funds are split transparently: <strong>$6M</strong> to initial liquidity (locked at listing),
  <strong>$3M</strong> to a locked reserve, and <strong>$2M</strong> to the development fund.
  No hidden mechanics — just clear rules you can read twice.
</p>

<h3>V2 — Immutable Core & Listing (💎 Quartz)</h3>
<p>
  The core token becomes immutable (no owner keys, no tricks). We publish the listing with locked liquidity,
  enable basic utilities (dashboard, referrals), and let the market do what the market does — without “admin magic”.
</p>

<h3>… Time Will Tell (🌀 → ⚛️ → 🧭)</h3>
<p>
  Partnerships, integrations, and everything that comes next are earned over time. We don’t force it, we don’t fake it.
  We build, ship, and let time prove the rest.
</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Summary:</strong> V1 lays the rails, V1.5 starts the journey with presale, V2 locks the route and opens the station (listing).
  Beyond that — Time Will Tell.
